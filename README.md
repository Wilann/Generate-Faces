### Overview

Training a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) on a dataset of faces to train it to generate new 
images of faces that look as realistic as possible. 

### Data 

[CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) is a large-scale face 
attributes dataset with more than 200K celebrity images, each with 40 attribute annotations. 
The images in this dataset cover large pose variations and background clutter. 
CelebA has large diversities, large quantities, and rich annotations, including:
- 10,177 number of identities,
- 202,599 number of face images, and
- 5 landmark locations, 40 binary attributes annotations per image.
